## Data Science Intern, UEFA

In my internship at the Intelligence Center of [UEFA](https://www.uefa.com), made possible through [CRSA](https://www.crsa.uzh.ch/en.html), I led the integration of online data repositories for strategic off-pitch football research, incorporating statistical and machine learning analysis to study player workload.  On the other hand, for the Football Team, I implemented football metrics utilizing tracking and event data sourced from UEFA, covering ball location,
press classification, progression classification, pass classification, running total of ball out of play, and running total of
effective time.

## Teaching Assistant, Soccer Analytics, ETH Zurich, Switzerland

After successfully completing the Soccer Analytics course, I became the teaching assistant for it. The course focuses on the use of data in tactical decision-making, strategic planning, and fan engagement within the context of association football. In my role as a teaching assistant, I was involved in checking the analysis of the groups and providing feedback to them. Additionally, I assisted them during the implementation of the metrics.

## Research Assistant, Social Networks Lab at ETH Zurich, Switzerland

I have worked under the supervision of Prof. Dr Ulrik Brandes in Social Network Lab. Our main focus was football analytics. There were two major projects that we have worked on. The main project employed spatio-temporal tracking data obtained from UEFA to generate automatic formation detection algorithms. Using the same dataset in the other project, the aim was to cluster passing patterns of players and teams by building spatial networks.

## Embedded Systems Intern, Kardinero Medical Systems, Turkey

In order to complete my summer internship in 2019, I have worked at [Kardinero Medical Systems](https://www.kardinero.com.tr). The focus of the internship was embedded systems. We have utilized NUCLE0F412ZG board with STM32 Cube IDE to communicate via Serial Peripheral Interface protocol. STEVAL-MKI178V2 chip was used to obtain gyroscope and accelerometer data which communicates with the NUCLE0F412ZG board via SPI protocol. 

## Embedded Systems Intern, FNSS Defence Systems, Turkey

My first internship took place at [FNSS Defence Systems](https://www.fnss.com.tr/en) in summer 2018. The focus of the internship was embedded systems. We have utilized NUCLEOL476RG board with STM32 Cube IDE to communicate via Controller Area Network protocol.
