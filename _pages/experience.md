## Research Experience

### Research Assistant, Social Networks Lab at ETH Zurich, Switzerland

I have been working under supervision of Prof. Dr Ulrik Brandes in Social Network Lab since June 2022. Our main focus is soccer analytics. There are two major projects that we have been working on. Initial project utilizes spatio-temporal tracking data obtained from UEFA to generate automatic formation detection algorithms. Using the same dataset in the other project, the aim is to cluster passing patterns of players and teams by building spatial networks.


## Industry Experience

### Intern, Kardinero Medical Systems, Turkey

In order to complete my summer internship in 2019, I have worked at [Kardinero Medical Systems](https://www.kardinero.com.tr). The focus of the internship was embedded systems. We have utilized NUCLE0F412ZG board with STM32 Cube IDE to communicate via Serial Peripheral Interface protocol. STEVAL-MKI178V2 chip is used to obtain gyroscope and accelerometer data which communicates with the NUCLE0F412ZG board via SPI protocol. 

### Intern, FNSS Defence Systems, Turkey

My first internship took place at [FNSS Defence Systems](https://www.fnss.com.tr/en) in summer 2018. The focus of the internship was embedded systems. We have utilized NUCLEOL476RG board with STM32 Cube IDE to communicate via Controller Area Network protocol.
