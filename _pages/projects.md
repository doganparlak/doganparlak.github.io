Below, You can find the projects I have completed during my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees.

## An Open-Source Implementation of FIFA’s Enhanced Football Intelligence, 

### University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, Master's Thesis
Research Question: Are the concepts in the Enhanced Football Intelligence document sufficiently detailed to allow for reproduction of FIFA’s match reports?  
The goal of the thesis is an open-source implementation of the concepts in the [Enhanced Football Intelligence](https://www.fifatrainingcentre.com/media/native/world-cup-2022/Enhanced%20Football%20Intelligence%20EN.pdf) document, and it’s validation on FIFA World Cup 2022 data. Where necessary to resolve ambiguities, alternatives can be tested, and potential improvements can be included.
## Italy v Spain Match Analysis, EURO 2020

### ETH Zurich, Soccer Analytics

We analyzed EURO 2020 semi-final match Italy against Spain. Various analysis techniques regarding players’ movement, passing, shooting, in-game and end-of-game match probabilities, set-pieces, player valuations, ratings are examined. Results of these analysis are collected in a match report based on the event data obtained from Statsbomb, and the tracking data obtained by the courtesy of UEFA is generated.

## UniFi: A Unified Framework for Portfolio Management

### University of Zurich, Master's Research Project

We have created a framework which provides its users the opportunity to compare different portfolio allocation methodologies. The framework consists of three main layers. Inital one is financial environment layer in which users can either fetch or import their own data and apply feature engineering. Second layer is model layer. It enables users to either use a conventional model or a reinforcement learning model as the portfolio allocation algorithm. Lastly, evaluation layer is utilized to apply back-testing and view the performance of the chosen algorithm with preferred performance metrics.

## Cryptocurrency Price Direction Prediction

### University of Zurich, Finance and Machine Learning

We set up a binary classification task which predicts the direction of “close prices” of the cryptocurrencies: ADA, BTC, DOGE, ETH and LTC utilizing high level frequency (minute level) data. Feature engineering is done to handcraft the most prevalent technical features used in technical analysis. Model-dependent and model-agnostic feature selection methods are utilized to select the most informative and relevant features. Decision tree model is built as a baseline and aimed to improve the prediction accuracy in varying time horizons using support vector machine, logistic regression, artificial neural network, recurrent neural network and random forest models.

## Alzheimer Phase Detection

### University of Zurich, Applied Business Modelling and Analaytics

We set up a multilabel classification task that utilizes fMRI images of distinct people who faced Alzheimer and predict the phase of their disease. There are four stages of the disease namely Non-Demented, Mild Demented, Moderate Demented and Very Mild Demented. A Convolutional Neural Network is built to train, validate and test the objective.

## Bee Smart

### Bilkent University, Bachelors Graduation Project

The project have embedded components consisting of GSM, GPS, Microphone, Weight, and Temperature sensors to monitor the smart hive in addition to Edge Learning. Main aim is to predict the internal conditions of the hive using bee sounds, while simultaneously reporting the results to a cloud server to establish the IoT communication over MQTT with Android and Web applications for the clients.

## Financial Risk Optimizing for Lending Club Lenders

### Bilkent University, Statistical Learning and Data Analytics

A binary classification task is constructed to predict whether the borrowers are going to fully pay their debt based on distinct loans considering the features of the borrowers. Dataset contains 1.300.000 loans with 75 features such as current, late, fully paid and latest payment information. Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine models are individually implemented from scratch.

## Fully Automated Crossword Generator

### Bilkent University, Artificial Intelligence

We developed a program that inputs clues of a 5x5 New York Times mini-puzzle and its solution. Its objective is to generate new clues. We have utilized definition extraction and scheme generation.
## Athlete Test

### Bilkent University, Microprocessors

We have developed an athlete test that uses distance, alcohol, heart rate and temperature sensors to determine the condition of an athlete. C++ programming language is used to program the board KL25Z. Keypad and LCD components are configured in order to obtain and display data using Arduino Uno.

## Goal Detector for Soccer Matches

### Bilkent University, Introductionn to Digital Circuit Design

We built a system that uses ultrasonic distance sensor and infrared distance sensor to detect whether a ball passes the goal line. Arduino Uno is used to obtain data from infrared distance sensor. VHDL is utilized to program Basys3 on Vivado to gather the data from ultrasonic distance sensors and to interpret the collected data.
