I am currently a master's student at the [University of Zurich (UZH)](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html), pursuing my degree in [Data Science](https://www.oec.uzh.ch/en/studies/master/it/ds.html) with a minor in [Banking and Finance](https://www.oec.uzh.ch/en/studies/master/oec/bf.html). Specifically, I am enrolled in the [Department of Informatics](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en.html) at UZH. My academic interests revolve around the application of Machine Learning and Network Science in the field of Sports Analytics, with a particular focus on soccer analytics. I feel fortunate to have the guidance of two esteemed professors, [Prof. Dr. Ulrik Brandes](https://gess.ethz.ch/en/the-department/people/person-detail.html?persid=239462) and Prof. [Dr. Claudio J. Tessone](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/bdlt/Team/Tessone.html), for my thesis research.

To further enrich my academic journey, I am actively involved in the Social Networks Lab as a research assistant and teaching assistant, working closely under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Ulrik Brandes. This opportunity allows me to contribute to ongoing research and gain valuable teaching experience.

My passion for Data Science and Finance initially sparked during my undergraduate studies as an Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at Bilkent University. The prospect of applying data science and analytics to finance and business-related domains excited me and motivated me to pursue a master's degree in this field at the University of Zurich."
