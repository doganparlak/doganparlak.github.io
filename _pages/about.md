About Me
======
I am a master's student at [University of Zurich (UZH)](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html) in the [Department of Informatics](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en.html). My major is [Data Science](https://www.oec.uzh.ch/en/studies/master/it/ds.html) and my minor is [Banking and Finance](https://www.oec.uzh.ch/en/studies/master/oec/bf.html). I am interested in machine learning and network science and their application on sports analytics, especially soccer analytics. I am working at [Social Networks Lab](https://sn.ethz.ch) as a research assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Ulrik Brandes](https://gess.ethz.ch/en/the-department/people/person-detail.html?persid=239462).
