*Fall seven times, stand up eight.*

I began my journey as an undergraduate student in [Electrical and Electronics Engineering](https://ee.bilkent.edu.tr/en/) at [Bilkent University](\href{https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/www/). During this time, I developed a strong interest in applying Data Science and Analytics to Finance and Business-related domains.

Driven by this passion, I pursued a Master's degree in [Data Science](https://www.oec.uzh.ch/en/studies/master/it/ds.html) with a minor in [Banking and Finance](https://www.oec.uzh.ch/en/studies/master/oec/bf.html) at the [University of Zurich (UZH)](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html). I was enrolled in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en.html) at UZH, where I deepened my knowledge in Data Science and Finance.

During my master's studies, I developed a particular interest in Machine Learning, Network Science, and Computational Geometry, especially within the context of Sports Analytics, with a specific focus on Football Analytics. I had the privilege of conducting my thesis research under the guidance of two esteemed professors,[Prof. Dr. Ulrik Brandes](https://gess.ethz.ch/en/the-department/people/person-detail.html?persid=239462) and [Prof. Dr. Claudio J. Tessone](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/bdlt/Team/Tessone.html).

To further enrich my academic experience, I worked as a research assistant and teaching assistant at the [Social Networks Lab](https://sn.ethz.ch) under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Ulrik Brandes. This role allowed me to contribute to ongoing research projects and gain valuable teaching experience.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I gained industry experience through a Data Science internship at [UEFA](https://www.uefa.com), where I applied my knowledge in a real-world setting both on and off the pitch.

After working as an Artificial Intelligence Engineer at [Abdi Business Technologies](https://www.abdibt.com.tr), I decided to take the next step and launch my own venture.

I am now the founder of [DPformance](https://dpformance.com), a data-driven consultancy focused on delivering advanced football analytics and insights. At DPformance, we help clubs, analysts, and stakeholders across the game make smarter decisions through dataâ€”enhancing understanding, communication, and strategy across all levels of football.
