I am a master's student at [University of Zurich (UZH)](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html) in the [Department of Informatics](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en.html). 
My major is [Data Science](https://www.oec.uzh.ch/en/studies/master/it/ds.html) and my minor is [Banking and Finance](https://www.oec.uzh.ch/en/studies/master/oec/bf.html). I am interested in Machine Learning and Network Science and their application on Sports Analytics, especially Soccer Analytics. I am working at [Social Networks Lab](https://sn.ethz.ch) as a research assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Ulrik Brandes](https://gess.ethz.ch/en/the-department/people/person-detail.html?persid=239462).
I took my first steps to areas Data Science and Finance at Bilkent University where I pursued my bachelors as an Electrical and Electronics Engineering student. The idea of applying Data Science and Analytics to Finance and Business related areas made me feel excited and lead me to pursue such a master's degree at University of Zurich.
